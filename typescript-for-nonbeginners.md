# Typescript for nonbeginners: a primer for experienced programmers

## Introduction
### Explanation of TypeScript and its relationship to JavaScript
### Overview of the Primer

## Setting Up Your Environment
### Installing Node.js and npm

**Node.js** is a runtime environment that lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a browser. This makes it possible to run JavaScript on your server or on your machine, just like you would run a Python or C++ script.

**npm**, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install and manage packages (libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) that your JavaScript or TypeScript projects might need. It's a crucial tool for modern JavaScript development.

To install Node.js and npm, you can use the package manager for your specific Linux distribution.
* For Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs npm
  ```
* For Red Hat-based distributions like CentOS or Fedora, you can use `dnf`:
  ```
  sudo dnf install nodejs npm
  ```
* For Arch-based distributions, you can use pacman:
  ```
  sudo pacman -Sy nodejs npm
  ```

After installation, verify that Node.js and npm were correctly installed by checking their versions:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

These commands should return the installed versions of Node.js and npm respectively. If you see version numbers, that means Node.js and npm are successfully installed and ready to use.

Remember that Node.js development moves quickly, so you'll want to update Node.js and npm frequently to ensure you have the latest features and security patches. You can use the same commands used for installation to update these tools.
